## ImagePyHtml

#ImagePyHtml.py 
Is the base idea, work with rgb images without loosing quality.

#ImagePyHtml - Optimized.py

WORK IN PROGRESS 

Still a bit buggy, can handle rgb, and rgba, its designed to get files wich size is lower compared to ImagePYHtml.py but eats one pixel at the right if the image.
